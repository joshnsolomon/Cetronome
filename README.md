# Cetronome

It's like the metronome that I made in [Python](https://github.com/joshnsolomon/metronome), but this time it's in C..

Get it? ..Cetronome

Why did I make this? idk

## Dependencies

You need [SDL2](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL2/Installation) and SDL2_Image and SDL2_ttf, get it however works for you.

___
Note for some reason on Mac OS you have to dynamically link to the SDL_Image library.. IDK why
